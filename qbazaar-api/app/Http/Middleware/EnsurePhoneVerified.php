/**
 * Blocks any route that requires a verified phone (OTP completed).
 *
 * Contract:
 *  - MUST be applied AFTER `auth:sanctum`. Without an authenticated user we
 *    respond 401 AUTH_TOKEN_INVALID — same shape as Sanctum's own failure.
 *  - When `$user->phone_verified` is false we respond 403 AUTH_003.
 *
 * Why not combine with EnsureUserIsActive?
 *  - Some endpoints need only the active check (e.g. settings), and we don't
 *    want to drag the phone-verified gate into them. Splitting keeps the
 *    middleware list opt-in per route.
 *
 * Wave-2 note: no Sprint-1 route applies this middleware. It exists because
 * Sprint 2 ad-posting and offers will gate on it; we want the contract +
 * tests in place now so the wire-up later is a one-line route change.
