/**
 * One-stop fan-out from ad-lifecycle events to seller notifications.
 *
 * Keeping the routing here (instead of one listener per event) means future
 * lifecycle hooks can be added by extending the switch — no provider edits
 * needed. The owning user is loaded once per event and short-circuits when
 * absent (a hard-deleted owner should never crash a queued listener).
 *
 * AdRenewed is intentionally silent for now — sellers click the renew button
 * themselves, so a "you renewed" mail is noise. Kept in the switch as a
 * placeholder for the eventual push-only confirmation.
