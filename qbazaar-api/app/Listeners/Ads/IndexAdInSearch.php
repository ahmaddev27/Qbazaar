/**
 * Pushes an ad into Meilisearch when it becomes publicly visible.
 *
 * Why a listener (instead of an inline call inside `Ad::publish()`)?
 *  - Same indexing behaviour applies to admin-approved ads (which arrive via
 *    AdApproved instead of AdPublished). One listener handles both pathways.
 *  - Keeps the publish flow declarative — search side effects are pluggable.
 *
 * Note: `Ad::publish()` already calls `$ad->searchable()` for the synchronous
 * happy-path; this listener is the safety net for the manual-approval path
 * AND will be the single hook when we move indexing to the queue in Wave C.
