 *
 * Why burn other sessions?
 *  - A password change is the standard "I think my account was compromised"
 *    self-remediation. Leaving every other session signed in would defeat the
 *    purpose; users expect the change to invalidate everything they didn't
 *    explicitly authorise.
 *
 * Why keep the CURRENT session alive?
 *  - Re-prompting the very user who just typed their old + new password
 *    to log in again on the active device is a poor UX and would surprise
 *    every modern app's users.
