# QBazaar — Error Code Catalog

All API errors carry a stable `code` field. Frontend clients use the `message_key`
field for i18n lookup; the `message` is a human-readable fallback in the
requested locale.

> Format: `<DOMAIN>_<NUMBER>` — e.g. `AUTH_001`, `AD_005`.
> Domain prefixes are 3-letter codes; numbers are zero-padded to 3 digits.

## Guidelines

- **Stability:** Once a code ships, it MUST NOT change meaning. If the meaning changes, introduce a new code.
- **Frontend behavior:** clients should switch on `code`, not on `message`. The message is for fallback display only.
- **i18n:** `message_key` maps 1:1 to a key in `lang/{ar,en}/errors.php` on the backend, and to a key in `i18n/{ar,en}.json` on the frontend.
- **Adding a new code:** add to this file in the relevant sprint section, increment the number, and reference the spec PR.
